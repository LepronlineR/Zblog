{% quot icon:default About Me %}

My name is Zhi Zheng, 

I was a Game Developer/Programmer for a small indie company at Rather Be Fishing, a small company at downtown Troy, NY. My interests are machine learning, programming, math, game development, and data science. I thrive to learn, understand deep topics and to endlessly improve. 

I immigrated from China to Flushing, NY when I was very young, now I live vicariously throughout the city. I graduated Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a bachelors in Game Development and Computer Science, as well as a masters in Computer Science. I had been a high achiever due to the competition in my high school, which was the Bronx Highschool of Science. I've been through hard and rigorous coursework, which has always pushed me. I am glad that I have been pushed this far by my professors, colleagues, teachers, parents, etc.

This blog is used personally for me to just put random things that I do. So please take any of this information in my blog with a degree of uncertainty and entropy. {% emoji blobcat ablobcatattentionreverse %}
